# Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networks

## 1.1 Introduction to Computer Networks and the Internet

### Definition and Basic Concepts
- Computer Network: A collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology
- The Internet: A collection of interconnected networks that use standardized communication protocols
- Network Protocols: Rules and conventions that govern communication between network devices

### Evolution of Computer Networks
- Early networks (1960s-1970s)
- ARPANET and the birth of the Internet
- The modern Internet era
- Current trends and future directions

### Types of Computer Networks
1. By Geographic Scale
   - LAN (Local Area Network)
   - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
   - WAN (Wide Area Network)

2. By Network Architecture
   - Client-Server
   - Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

### The Internet and Society
- Impact on communication
- E-commerce and digital economy
- Social media and social networking
- Education and remote learning
- Challenges and concerns (privacy, security, digital divide)

## 1.2 Internet Structure

### Network Edge
- End systems (hosts)
- Client and server programs
- Network interfaces

### Access Networks
- DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
- Cable networks
- Fiber to the home (FTTH)
- Wireless access networks
- Enterprise access networks

### Network Core
- Packet switching
- Circuit switching
- Network of networks

### Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Tier-1 ISPs
- Regional ISPs
- Local ISPs
- ISP interconnection points

### Protocol Layers
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Link Layer
5. Physical Layer
